# 20 - Plot Twist

#### Overview

Utilize your browser's javascript console

#### Problem

We need to get the flag at this site. That shouldn't be too hard.

#### Solution

For a 20 point problem, it would reasonable to assume that the flag would be hidden in an obvious place.  We first try to view the source of the website, but we see the following comment:

We then proceed to check the javascript console (F12 for chrome).  The flag is indeed logged in the console.
